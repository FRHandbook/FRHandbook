# Handbook of Face Recognition (3rd Edition) 

The Deep Neural Network Approach (with Data and Code)

## Aim and Scope

Face recognition is the most prominent biometric technique for identity authentication and is widely used in applications, 
such as access control, finance, law enforcement, and public security. 
It is a long-standing research, with over 50 years of research and developments. 
Advances in deep learning and neural networks have significantly reshaped 
the landscape of face recognition research and applications in almost all aspects since the first two editions 
([1st Edition](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387272573) and [2nd Edition](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780857299314)) of this Handbook. 

This third edition, while inheriting the title of Handbook of Face Recognition, 
will be composed of entirely new contents describing the latest face recognition methodologies and technologies in the deep neural network framework. 
The book presents a unified resource of theory, algorithms and implementations to bring students, researchers and practitioners 
to all aspects of face recognition. 
The book not only presents the latest developments in methods and algorithms, 
but also provides data and code to allow for hands-on learning and developing reproducible face recognition algorithms and systems (Appendix) by deep learning programming. 
The data and code will be released in this Github and will be updated subsequently to keep the materials up to date.
